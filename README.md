# Blink-Detection-System
Real-time detection of facial landmarks from camera images, especially tracking eye movements to detect and count blinks.

## Overview

This project uses a combination of OpenCV and MediaPipe to analyze real-time video from a camera, detect facial landmarks, and monitor blink frequency using eye landmarks in particular. This system can be used to measure eye fatigue and concentration.

## Requirement

- **Operating System**: macOS
- **OpenCV**: Used to acquire video from the camera and for basic image processing.
- **MediaPipe**: Used for facial landmark detection.
- **Matplotlib**: Used for data visualization.
- **NumPy**: Used for numerical calculations.

## Features

- Real-time detection of facial landmarks using the MediaPipe Face Mesh model.
- Blink detection using eye landmarks.
- Real-time display of blink frequency on the frame.
- Analysis of the iris position data using Fourier transform to study frequency components.
